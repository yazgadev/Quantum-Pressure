## Introduction

Quantum physics may or may not be the final frontier in science but it
is without a doubt closer to reality than Classical physics.

Quantization is translation of a crude understanding of physical
phenomena to a more profound way which known as quantum.

One of the questions on quantum physics is whether we can quantize the
subject of **pressure** with quantum terms.

To answer this question, we will look at particle behavior in terms of
wave functions and analyze phenomenon of pressure from scratch with the
new language. Upon reaching a statement it will become clear that not
only pressure but most of classical physics can be translated alongside
and this will open the doors for quantization of all science.

This study also emphasizes the importance of an elevated understanding.

## Information

Sufficient information about the wave function is given below with
sequential numbering which will later be referred.

1. According to quantum mechanics all particles in the universe are
   described by a wave function
2. Properties of a particle such as position and momentum are not
   defined until they are observed
3. The probability of each possible state is determined by the wave
   function
4. <span id="bullet4"></span> The probability of a particle being at a
   particular position is given by square of the amplitude of the wave
   function at that location (The bigger the amplitude the more
   probable the particle is at that location)
5. <span id="bullet5"></span> Frequency of the rotation of the wave
   function determines the energy of the particle. A particle with a
   higher energy will have a wave function which rotates with a higher
   frequency (The higher the energy the higher the frequency)
6. <span id="bullet6"></span> Momentum of the particle is determined by
   the wave length of the wave function. A longer wave length will
   imply a smaller momentum
7. Many wave functions can be superposed into one
8. If we combine two different waves with different energy levels, the
   energy of the particle becomes uncertain ([see \#5](#bullet5)). When
   we measure the energy of the particle the superposed wave function
   will collapse into one of the two original wave functions

Briefly:

- Rotation frequency of the wave ↔ Energy of the particle
- Amplitude of the wave ↔ Position of the particle
- Length of the wave ↔ Momentum of the particle

## Hypothesis

Let’s consider a particle moving on a line (in a single direction) with
a known momentum.

- If we know its momentum we also know its wave function. But we derive
  the probability of its position from the amplitude of the wave. Since
  the particle is moving, the amplitude of the wave function is the same
  everywhere and therefore the position is unknown.

- We are more likely to guess its position if its wave function is a
  superposed one from several different wave functions rather than just
  one simple function ([see \#4](#bullet4)). But if this is the case we
  cannot guess its momentum since there will be many waves combined
  which means there will be several different wave lengths in the
  function ([see \#6](#bullet6)).

- If we want to guess the position precisely, we have to limit the peak
  amplitude in a narrow interval and this means we have to superpose
  many wave functions into one. This adds many different wave lengths
  into equation and therefore makes it harder to guess the momentum.

These mean that the more information we have about the position of a
particle the less knowledge we have about its momentum or vice versa.

- If the particle is traveling freely through space, there can be
  infinite amount of different possible wave functions. In other words
  there can be infinite amount of possibilities for the energy level of
  the particle.

- If the particle is trapped inside a box, now the only possible wave
  functions are the ones which ensure that the amplitude of the wave
  function is zero at the boundary of the box ([see \#4](#bullet4)).

All of these mean for a particle trapped inside a box, only a finite
amount of wave functions are possible. Therefore only certain energy
levels are allowed.

Let’s assume we have a closed box with some gas (say air) inside. If we
heat the box, the temperature inside the box will also rise and the
energy levels of the gas particles will increase. This will cause
changes on the wave functions of the particles, meaning they will rotate
with a higher frequency.

To be able to understand easily, think about a rope in a jump rope game.
As the rope rotates faster and faster at some point it will burst at
either one or both ends of the rope from the hands of the children. In
the wave function this can be observed as a raise on the amplitude where
it was zero before. In other words, heating will cause the wave function
to overflow the boundary from inside to outside. After some point it
will reach a degree that the position of the particle will more likely
be outside than inside ([see \#4](#bullet4)). When many particles reach
this type of heightened energy level, the box will no longer be able to
endure the quantum pressure and will explode.

Also consider this example of **heating a box** side by side with
**heating a teapot with some water inside**.

## Conclusion

If these are true, most physics phenomena can be translated at the same
time in terms of quantum mechanics:

- What does the term pressure mean and what is gas pressure as opposed
  to the old explanation?

- Why do containers explode?

- For a certain matter;
  1. Why does solid state of the matter crystallize and the particles
     of a solid stay close to each other? State of the lowest energy
     level, amplitudes of the wave functions quickly drops near zero
     around the particles and therefore they are not able to wander
     freely.
  2. Why does liquid state of the same matter become fluid and dynamic
     but its particles still do not scatter like gases? Higher energy
     than solid state (medium energy level between solid and gas)
     meaning some movement possible but no dispersion.
  3. Why do particles in gas state disperse? (Highest energy level)

- Why do solids melt or liquids freeze? What do terms like melting point
  and boiling point mean?

- Why do liquids evaporate or gases condensate? Either surface
  evaporation which also explains its slowness or boiling which also
  explains its speed.

- For a planet within the circumstellar habitable zone of its planetary
  system (goldilocks zone); why does its atmosphere have a certain
  height? Temperature (energy) change from the surface of a planet to
  higher altitudes cause wave forms of the air particles to have higher
  amplitudes closer to the ground and near zero amplitude furthest from
  the ground. This also explains why density of air is higher closer to
  ground as opposed to the classical gravity explanation. This is a way
  for quantization of gravity.

If these can be verified, all definitions in classical physics can be
redefined in terms of quantum physics.
